        <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 serving chocolate protein powder</li>
            <li>2 tbsp cacao powder</li>
            <li>1 cup oat milk</li>
            <li>1 tbsp nut butter</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Combine the protein powder, cacao powder and milk in a bowl. Stir well until most of the lumps are fully removed. Start with 3/4 cup of dairy free milk and add a little at a time so it doesn't get too runny.</li>
            <li>Once the lumps are gone, add the creamy almond butter or melted coconut butter and stir well until you have a pudding consistency.</li>
            <li>Refrigerate up to 8 hours or serve immediately.</li>
        </ol>
